## Introduction ##

Hello everyone, thanks for joining and helping me out. Itt might not be the most sophisticated prgramming challenge in the world, but nevertheless it's one I had run out of steam on alone. I hadn't considered anything like this, sharing the work out and spreading the load, and that alone has refreshed my appetite somewhat. Thanks for agreeing to help!

## A brief history of the website ##

The website was stolen (with permission) from Jonny Lyon (jonny on the forum)'s original site, which was maintained on an Excel spreadsheet which he saved as a webpage and uploaded. Whilst that is a fairly easy to maintain system (add new time, sort, save, upload), I decided to take on the challenge of making it a bit more fancy. I went live before I intended when jonny's site disappeared, and that's pretty much the state it is still in now - functional but stalled. As I said on the forum, I pretty much lost all my momentum when it came to developing it, with so much (see the Issues page) left to do on it. Since then, I have been labouriously inputting new data manually via MySQL...

## The future ##

Hopefully now there's a few of us, things can go forward. I've been listing issues I wished to address when I ran it alone on the issues page, so we can all take a look and decide if they really are issues or not, whether to develop them. Add anything that comes to mind. I can even try and chip in. The first task may well to get my code looking respectable. I won't take offence, so do what's necessary!

Cheers

Matt :)
